# EBugMe

The EBugMe Web Application was created to grant R2H Apprentices a glimpse of what their day-to-day will look like as Software Engineers. Sometimes the codebases we work on do not start from the bottom. It's important to know how to read another engineer's code and then provide your own solution on top of theirs.

The EBugMe Web Application contains a few different challenges in the form of tickets. The apprentices will be tasked with finding the solution for each of these tickets and then pushing up their change to repair the App!
